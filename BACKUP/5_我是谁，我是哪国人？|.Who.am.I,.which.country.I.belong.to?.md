# [我是谁，我是哪国人？| Who am I, which country I belong to?](https://github.com/cufezhusy/cufezhusy.github.io/issues/5)

不知道是不是每一个在海外待久了的中国人都会有类似的困惑。

我内心深处当然还是觉得自己是中国人，毕竟，童年时背过的那些唐诗宋词依然历历在目，仿佛刻在了记忆深处，无法磨灭。无论走到哪里，古诗词中描绘的山川风物和文化情感，总能唤起我对故乡的眷恋和自豪感。

但每次回国，总感觉有些陌生与不习惯。国内的生活节奏似乎越来越快，变化也令人眼花缭乱。我发现自己已经可以几年不吃中餐，对一些曾经熟悉的事物开始变得淡漠。甚至国内的新闻，对我而言也似乎越来越遥远，尽管它们依然重要，却不再能像过去那样引起我的强烈关注。我不再完全融入那个我曾熟悉的世界，仿佛我与它之间有了一层无形的屏障。

这让我感到困惑——我还是中国人吗？如果是，为什么我感到疏离？

与此同时，虽然我喜欢欧洲的许多方面：这里的自由价值观，对个人的尊重，注重隐私与独立的社会氛围，甚至是这里丰富多样的美食文化，但我从未感觉自己完全属于这个社会。欧洲的某些文化和价值观与我的成长背景和文化认同似乎始终存在某种不契合感。我可以适应这里的生活，融入日常的工作和社交，但当面对欧洲社会深层次的某些问题时，我依然感到一种距离感，仿佛我站在一个旁观者的位置，无法完全参与其中。

换句话说，我处于一种两边都不完全归属的状态。每次想到如果换成欧洲的护照，而放弃中国的护照，总让我心生犹豫。这不仅仅是一张身份证明的选择，更是对身份认同的深刻抉择。如果我做出这样的决定，是否意味着我真的在心灵深处割舍了自己的中国身份？但同时，如果不做这个选择，我是否又真的能在欧洲建立起一个完整而持久的身份认同？

或者说，我真的需要这样的身份认同吗？还是说国家只是一群人聚在一起时的想象，因此其实并无所谓你时哪国人？所谓的‘此心安处是吾乡’？

> 常羡人间琢玉郎，天应乞与点酥娘。尽道清歌传皓齿，风起，雪飞炎海变清凉。
万里归来颜愈少，微笑，笑时犹带岭梅香。试问岭南应不好，却道：此心安处是吾乡。

I wonder if every Chinese person who has lived abroad for a long time experiences similar confusion.

Deep down, I still consider myself Chinese. After all, the Tang and Song poetry I memorized during my childhood remains vivid in my mind, almost as if it's etched into my memory, impossible to erase. No matter where I go, the landscapes and emotions depicted in those ancient poems always evoke a sense of nostalgia and pride in my homeland.

Yet, every time I return to China, I feel a certain unfamiliarity and discomfort. Life in China seems to be speeding up, with changes happening so quickly that it’s overwhelming. I’ve realized I can now go years without eating Chinese food, and I’ve grown indifferent to things that were once familiar. Even the news from China feels increasingly distant. While it’s still important, it no longer grabs my attention as it used to. I no longer feel fully immersed in the world I once knew; it’s as if an invisible barrier has formed between us.

This leaves me confused—am I still Chinese? If so, why do I feel this sense of alienation?

At the same time, although I appreciate many aspects of Europe—its values of freedom, respect for the individual, the emphasis on privacy and independence, and even its rich and diverse culinary culture—I have never felt like I completely belong here. Some aspects of European culture and values never fully align with my upbringing and cultural identity. I can adapt to life here, fitting into the routine of work and social life, but when confronted with deeper issues in European society, I still feel a sense of detachment, as if I am merely an observer, unable to fully participate.

In other words, I find myself in a state of not fully belonging to either side. Every time I consider the possibility of switching to a European passport and giving up my Chinese one, I hesitate. It’s not just a choice of legal documentation; it feels like a profound decision about my identity. If I make such a choice, does it mean I am truly severing my Chinese identity in some deep, emotional way? But at the same time, if I don’t make that choice, will I ever be able to fully establish a complete and lasting identity in Europe?

Or perhaps, do I even need such an identity? Is the concept of nationality merely an imagined idea formed by groups of people, and therefore, does it really matter which country you belong to? As the saying goes, “Home is where the heart is”?
